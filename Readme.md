# Introduction

This is a git repository of various Sanskrit documents and related items. 

# Unicode
Unlike just a few years ago, Unicode support has really transformed support for Devanagari. Back in the day, one needed 
special fonts and special software just to read/write Devanagari on a computer. Not anymore. All documents in this
repo are just plain text files. That means you can grep them, cat them, split them, read them, write them etc all
in a text editor. On my Mac, I change my language settings to Devanagari and use Textedit as my editor. 

# TODO

1. Translate this Readme to Sanskrit!
2. Add more documents. 

# Final

All errors are mine and mine alone. To fix them, just fork the repository and send a pull request.
