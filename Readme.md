# Introduction

This is a git repository of various Sanskrit documents and related items. So, why a git repository? That's the first
question that anyone would ask. The answer is simple. There are thousands of documents and some very good 
sources/repositories but there is no way to update/fix/improve/change/modify any of them. Whereas using a git repo
solves all that because everything is under version control. Contributors can fork easily and send a pull request,
and automatically, a new document or a correction will be applied. 

# Background and Motivation

My own knowledge of Sanskrit is poor and I'm pretty horrible at languages. I was taught Sanskrit as a third language in 
Middle School and then as a second language in High School. The only reason for choosing Sanskrit as my second language 
was because the rules back then said that 50% of the final paper could be answered in English, Kannada or Sanskrit.
40% of the marks were for Grammer and 10% was for a translation from English/Kannada to Sanskrit. This meant that
if you could write long essays in English, rote-learn a bit of grammer and attempt the translation, you could easily
score decent marks even if you didn't really know the language. That's why I chose it as my second language and
scored a solid 83% in Sanskrit in my final year.

They did away with that rule a few years after I graduated high school but thankfully I was done.

This repository is primarily to relearn the language in my own way. A lot of people suggest speaking Sanskrit is the 
right way and what was taught back in the day was incorrect. I can't see a fault with that. In fact I would recommend
doing that for anyone else learning Sanskrit.

However that's not the goal of this repo. What this repo gives is an opportunity for me to read Sanskrit and 
hopefully make some sense of it. My goal is to add a document as I finish reading it. My way of reading is to write it
down! Note that there is a huge difference between reading/writing something and actually understanding it! ;-)

# Unicode
Unlike just a few years ago, Unicode support has really transformed support for Devanagari. Back in the day, one needed 
special fonts and special software just to read/write Devanagari on a computer. Not anymore. All documents in this
repo are just plain text files. That means you can grep them, cat them, split them, read them, write them etc all
in a text editor. On my Mac, I change my language settings to Devanagari and use Textmate as my editor. I can also
use the inbuilt Textedit. I tried Emacs for a while but itrans-devanagari on Emacs isn't my cup of tea. You can
use anything you want.

# TODO

1. Translate this Readme to Sanskrit!
2. Add more documents. 

# Final
All errors are mine and mine along. To fix them, just fork the repository and send a pull request.
